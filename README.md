## Description of the repository:
This is a repo containing generated videos using VRNN for keypoints prediction in the First Order Motion Model (FOMM) pipeline. 

## Directory Contents:

In each video, there are 4 boxes as follows: 

1.  The source image 

2. Driving video frames with keypoints

3. Generated video from FOMM pipeline

4. Generated video from FOMM with keypoints prediction using VRNN
